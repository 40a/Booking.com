The input is a list of names in random order. We need a function that chains elements
of the list in such a way that the last character of an name is the same as the first
one of the next name.

For instance:
- Input: [“Raymond”, “Nora”, “Daniel”, “Louie”, “Peter”, “Esteban”]
- Output: [“Peter”, “Raymond”, “Daniel”, “Louie”, “Esteban”, “Nora”]

There should be only one solution, so the first element is unique.
